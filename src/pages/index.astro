  <h1>hello, my name is ty carlson</h1>

  <p>
    I have been building websites, web apps, mobile apps, design systems, and most anything in
    between for over a decade. I am currently a Senior Frontend Engineer at{' '}

    I currently live in Connecticut with my wife (Lauren), son (Liam), and daughter (Remi).

  <h2>reading</h2>
  <p>
    Several years ago I re-invigorated my love of reading, and began setting yearly goals and
    tracking the books I chose to read. Here is that list of books I've read, grouped by year.
  </p>
  <ul class="flex flex-wrap">
    {readingPosts.map((post) => (
      <li class="mr-4 mb-4">
        <a href={`/reading/${post.slug}`}>{post.data.title}</a>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>

  <h2>photography</h2>
  <p>
    Be forewarned, I'm an amateur photographer at best. I bought an old{' '}
    <a href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Yashica_FX-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
      Yashica FX-2
    </a>{' '}
    on eBay to try out film, and quickly learned how expensive it is to process. The DIYer in me
    figured out how to process and scan the film myself. I still don't <em>actually</em> know what
    I'm doing, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2021, I upgraded my equipment to shoot medium format with a{' '}
    <a
      href="http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Mamiya_M645_Super,_Pro,_Pro_TL_and_E"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer"
    >
      Mamiya 645 Super
    </a>{' '}
    and am really loving the format so far. Fingers crossed I don't burn too much more money on this
    hobby!
  </p>
  <ul class="columns-1 sm:columns-2 lg:columns-3">
    {photographyPosts.map((post) => (
      <li class="break-inside-avoid">
        <a href={`/photography/${post.slug}`}>{post.data.title}</a>
        {post.data.excerpt && (
          <p class="mt-1 mb-0">
            <small>{post.data.excerpt}</small>

        )}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>

  <h2>code</h2>
  <p>
    I write code for a living. From time to time I get the hankering to put something out into the
    world as open source, available to anyone who might want to use it. Here are a couple of those
    projects.
  </p>
  <ul class="flex flex-wrap">
    {codePosts.map((post) => (
      <li class="mr-4 mb-4">
        {post.data.archived ? (
          <span class="strikethrough">
            <a href={`/code/${post.slug}`}>{post.data.title}</a>
          </span>
        ) : (
          <a href={`/code/${post.slug}`}>{post.data.title}</a>
        )}
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
